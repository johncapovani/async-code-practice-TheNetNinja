ASYNC JavaScript Learning Notes:

Async Javascript: One of the most important pieces of javascript
- Governs how we perform tasks which take some time to complete
-> Start now -> Finish later -> Resulting in non blocking code

JavaScript by default is a synchronous language, async code allows developers the ability to await specific tasks. Break out of the single threaded language.

Scenerio: We want to call a bunch of files, one step must make a request to a server. In a traditional sychronous programming the function that runs to return a response from a server will stall the program.

Solution: Async code comes in because it allows us to pause the program in a sense as the one task is running and the other items can continue.
